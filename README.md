# KnitSpace

![Mock Up Image](assets/readme-files/images/mockup.png)

KnitSpace is a vibrant online community for knitters of all levels to share, learn, and connect. Users can browse blog posts on various knitting-related topics without logging in. They can also create an account to save their favourite posts or create their own.

Visit the deployed application [here](https://knit-space-57239e7d6ce8.herokuapp.com/).

## Project Planning 

### Agile Methodology

Agile methodology played a crucial role in managing the development process. The project was divided into smaller sprints, each focusing on adding a specific feature or improving an existing function.
The first sprint focused on setting up a basic blog application, which formed the project's foundation. The application allows users to browse through post previews and open the full post by clicking on the preview. Users are not required to log in to the site to view posts. 
The second sprint focused on implementing user authentication. Once implemented, it allows users to create an account using their email address and log into and out of the account. After future sprints, logged-in users can access exclusive areas of the blog.
The third sprint focused on setting up the Dashboard and its functionality. The Dashboard serves as a space for registered users to view their favourite posts. Posts can be saved and removed from the Dashboard via a button and rearranged with a drag-and-drop feature. Due to time constraints, the functionality to reorder blog posts was moved into the next sprint.
The fourth sprint focused on completing the drag-and-drop functionality and adding additional user functions. Logged-in users can create blog posts, including custom images, and edit and delete their posts after creation.
The fifth sprint focused on adding an *About* page to the blog to allow users to connect with its fictional host.
The sixth sprint focused on enhancing the user experience by improving existing features and addressing issues that had become apparent during testing. Some examples include:
- A *My Posts* page was created, allowing users to manage all their posts comfortably in one place.
- Messages after saving, updating, or deleting a post were added to provide users with immediate feedback on their actions.
- A confirmation modal was added before posts are permanently deleted to avoid accidental deletions that cannot be undone.
- Custom pages for the two most common errors encountered during production - 404 and 404 - were created.

GitHub Projects was an essential tool for tracking progress and managing tasks throughout the Agile development process. A Kanban-style board was used to track progress visually. Each issue was based on a user story and moved through the different phases of *To Do*, *In Progress*, and *Done*, following the corresponding sprints. 
Custom labels were created to distinguish the issues visually. Labels were used to assign a priority - *must-have*, *should-have*, *could-have* or *will-not-have*, based on the MOSCOW model of prioritization -  as well as a functionality - *C*, *R*, *U*, or *D*, to reference their role within the *CRUD* functionality.

### CRUD Functionality

*CRUD* functionality has been implemented throughout the project to create an entirely usable experience for the user.

Admin (superuser only)
- *C*: Create new users and posts.
- *R*: Read or view all users and posts.
- *U*: Update posts and user information.
- *D*: Delete posts and users.

Dashboard (logged-in users only)
- *C*: Create a new entry by saving a post to the Dashboard.
- *R*: View all saved posts and open them in full-page view.
- *U*: Update the order of the posts via drag and drop.
- *D*: Delete a post from the Dashboard.

Content Management (logged-in users only)
- *C*: Create a new post.
- *R*: View newly created and previous posts (guest users can view all posts).
- *U*: Update own blogposts.
- *D*: Delete own blogposts.

**Note**: The *CRUD* functionality for content management has been implemented in multiple places. Users can update and delete their posts from the *My Post* section and the full-page view of each post. Users can also create a new post from their account menu and the *My Post* section.

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

During planning, [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com) was used to visualize the relationships between the models in this application. The relationships are between *User*, *BlogPost*, and *SavedPost*. *About* is an independent entity with no relation to the other models.

<details>
<summary> Entity Relationship Diagrams Image</summary>
<img src = "assets/readme-files/images/planning-erd.png">
</details>

#### User Entity
User -> BlogPost:
- Each User can be the author of multiple *BlogPost* instances. This represents a one-to-many (1:N) relationship where the *User* is on the "one" side, and each *BlogPost* is on the "many" side.
- In the model, this relationship is facilitated by a ForeignKey in the *BlogPost* model pointing to the *User*.

User -> SavedPost:
- Each User can save multiple blog posts, resulting in several *SavedPost* entries. This is another one-to-many (1:N) relationship.
- This is implemented via a ForeignKey in the *SavedPost* model, which points back to the user.

#### BlogPost Entity
BlogPost -> User:
- A *BlogPost* is authored by the *User*, which is a many-to-one relationship where multiple *BlogPost* instances can be associated with a single *User*.

BlogPost -> SavedPost:
- Each BlogPost can be saved by multiple users, represented by multiple SavedPost entries. This defines another one-to-many (1:N) relationship, where *SavedPost* serves as an intermediary.

#### SavedPost Entity
BlogPost -> User:
- This is a many-to-one relationship, illustrating that multiple saved posts can belong to a single user.

BlogPost -> SavedPost:
- This is a many-to-one relationship, indicating that multiple users can save the same blog post.

### Design Choices
#### Color Palette

The color palette uses three colors taken from the header image to maintain a consistent style, as well as standard white. The colors were chosen for their pastel look to help create a pleasant and soothing experience for the user. Only three colors were used to support that experience. The palette was generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/image-picker).
- #FFFFFF (white): Cards and input fields are white to stand out.
- #FAF9F6 (baby powder): This was chosen as a background for the site to create a softer look. 
- #CDBABE (thistle): This was chosen for the header and footer to frame the page content visually. 
- #538EA3 (blue / munsell): This was chosen for the site's buttons.

<summary> Color Pallette Image</summary>

</details>

#### Typography

Fonts were paired and imported using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).
*Sigmar* was chosen as the font for the logo and the header text due to its bold, decorative lettering. For the main text, *Poppins* was used, as it offers a clean, modern design that is easy to read in various styles and sizes.

</details>

#### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes for each page to display their appearance on both mobile and larger devices.

Page | Desktop Version | Mobile Version
--- | --- | ---
Home | --- | ---
About | --- | ---
Dashboard | --- | ---
My Posts | --- | ---
Blog Post View | --- | ---
Edit / Create Post | --- | ---
Sign Up / Sign In | --- | ---
404 | --- | ---

#### Pre-existing Posts

In order to create a realistic, immersive feeling for new users, a total of 30 blog posts have been designed and uploaded into the database as a .json file. These posts were created with six user personas in mind and were given various created_on dates to make a well-established blog appear. Posts were initially supposed to be displayed by their last_modified rather than their created_on date. However, frequent testing and updates throughout the process meant that these dates were much closer together than initially anticipated. To maintain the feeling of a pre-existing blog, the decision was made to order posts by their created_on date instead.

### Pages

#### Home Page

The *Home* page previews all available blog posts, ordered from most to least recent. Each post is presented in a clickable card that opens the full-page view. Each card contains an image at the top, which defaults to a preset image unless changed by the user when creating a post, followed by the author, date, and, lastly, the excerpt, if available.
Arrows at the bottom of the page allow users to browse between multiple pages.

<summary> Home Page Image </summary>
<img src = "assets/readme-files/images/home-page.png">
</details>

#### Post Previews & Detail Views

Post previews are displayed as cards showing an image, the post's title, the author and creation date, and an excerpt. Images are optional; if users choose not to upload a custom image, a default image is displayed.

When clicking on a blog post preview card, a full-page view opens. This view presents the user with the post's title, author, date, and full text. A *Back* button above the post allows users to return to the *Home* page. Additionally, for logged-in users, a *Save* button above the post will enable users to save their favorite posts to their Dashboard. The author of each post also sees a drop-down menu allowing them to edit or delete their posts. A confirmation modal prevents users from accidentally deleting posts.
